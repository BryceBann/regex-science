# Matching with hex regex
With this walk through we will be looking at how one would go about matching hex values and the ways it can be used. The main uses of hex would be either in RGB color coding mainly used in CSS or with base-10 and base-16 syntax

## Summary
In this walk through we will be using the following regex code snippet:  
`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

In the above code snippet follows multiple small rules that allow us to find any hex code with 6 or three characters

## Regex Components

### Anchors
To declare the start of a regex you will use the carrot or `^` before you start to create your regex. To declare the ending of a regex you would then enter a dollar sign or `$` this will end youre regex. A simple exampale to see this would look like `/^\d\d:\d\d$/` this is showing that your regex will have two digits followed by a colon and two more digits.
